# Here we create custom tools that allow some behaviors coded from scratch.   #
# To create these tools, as indicated in the documentation, you need to       #
# create a description in their docstring, so that the agent knows when and   #
# how to use them.                                                            #
# The @tool decorator identifies custom tools, that can be then implemented   #
# as any other python function.                                               #
# It is preferrable to type the arguments of this function to avoid execution #
# bugs when used by the agent.                                                #
